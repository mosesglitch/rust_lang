// Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words
// Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. 
// It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.
